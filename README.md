# Newton-board-game
Welcome to the game of Newton, where you try to be the first to get 5 in a row either vertically, 
horizontally or diagonally. Two players alternate making moves. On each turn you may enter the 
column number where your piece will be placed, where that piece is inserted from the top and 
slides down as far as it can go in that column. You may also enter 'r' to rotate a piece out         
of the bottom of a column to be dropped back in at the top of that column.  Enter 'x' to exit.
